# GravityDoc
The physics simulation x text editor you've always wanted.

![](img/gravitydoc.gif)

## Core Features:
* Changing force settings in real time
* Handling basic text editing instructions like copy (ctrl c), paste (ctrl v), save (ctrl s), etc
* Cheatcodes and their features, which shall be kept secret, unless you poke around in the source code

## Implementation

### Physics and Rendering
Physics simulation is powered by matter.js, rendering with p5.js. I got these libraries to work together somehow.
### Hotkeys and Cheatcodes
They exist.
### Styling and Layout
HTML/ CSS was my least favorite part of this project. Lets not talk about it.
